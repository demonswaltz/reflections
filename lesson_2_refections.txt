initialinze a repository creates a file that logs changes in the working
directory.  Without this file git wouldn't be able to save snapshots of 
the directory

The staging area is an in between the working directory and the 
repository.  It allows you to select which file changes are in included
in a particular commit.

You can make changes to multiple files and then use the staging area to 
perform multiple commits to ensure that each commit only includes 
logical changes.

When creating a testing things before adding them to the final version.
Branches allow you to have more than one working version saved at a time.
