initialinze a repository creates a file that logs changes in the working
directory.  Without this file git wouldn't be able to save snapshots of 
the directory

The staging area is an in between the working directory and the 
repository.  It allows you to select which file changes are in included
in a particular commit.

You can make changes to multiple files and then use the staging area to 
perform multiple commits to ensure that each commit only includes 
logical changes.

When creating a testing things before adding them to the final version.
Branches allow you to have more than one working version saved at a time.

by looking at where each commit is connect to the lines of branches you
are able to get an idea of how they are related.. this is a dumb question.

merge takes two seperate branches compares them to the point where they 		
split and removes anything that was removed from either branch since the 
split and adds anything that has been added since the split.  Creating 
a new branch that is a hybrid of the two.

Git does a good job of looking at the changes made and comparing them to
previous versions.  It is able to easily see where changes have been made.
It is not always good at deciding which change is the one that needs to be
kept, but will point out and allow the user to make that decision.  It is 
much faster at finding and comparing changes than you would be manually.
