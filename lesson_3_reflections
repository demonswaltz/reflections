When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Keeping your work local is good if you are the only one working on it or accessing it.
    It would be a good idea to create a remote repository if you are sharing with other
    people or if you  are using a service that accesses your code...
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If multiple people are working on the same file pulling changes might 
	write over changes you've made so being able to choose when you pull
	files will make it easier to not lose your work.
