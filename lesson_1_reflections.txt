By being able to look at only the difference between the files
it was much easier to spot the errors.
Looking through every line of code would make it much harder because
you'd have to track two documents side by side.
The notation for diff -u is also helpful in that it shows what was in 
the old document vs. what is in the new document.

if you have access to all the old version of a file you can easily 
revert to the place before you made the mistake eliminate the mistake 
and correct it going forward.

When saving is a matter of retaining data in the event of a system 
malfunction (i.e. losing power, or Windows freezing) and not a matter of
creating a piece of compilable code then automatic saving on a timed 
interval will get the job done.  If, however, the point of saving is to 
have a piece of working code then a manual commit makes the most sense.

If you break it  you can always just go back and start over... no blood no foul
